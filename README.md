## HR Analytics Case Study
### Objective
The analysis aims to identify key factors contributing to employee churn and recommend actionable strategies for retention. 

### Key Insights
1. **Inactive Employees**: 16.12% of the total workforce are inactive.
2. **Age Distribution**: Majority of employees fall within the age range of 25 - 40 years.
3. **Department**: Attention needed in R&D and Sales. Surprisingly, 30.16% of HR employees are inactive despite constituting only 4.29% of the total workforce.
4. **Job Level**: Lower-level employees (levels 1 and 2) constitute the majority.
5. **Job Role**: The highest attrition rate is observed among Inactive Research Directors (23.75%).
6. **Tenure**: Employees tend to leave within the first 10 years of service, with the highest attrition rate observed among those with less than 5 years of tenure (24.31%).
7. **Training Times**: Employees attending 2-3 training sessions annually exhibit higher attrition rates, warranting a closer look into training programs.

### Recommendations
- Implement retention strategies targeted at HR department.
- Conduct exit interviews to understand reasons behind attrition among Research Directors.
- Enhance training programs to address the observed correlation between training frequency and attrition.
- Establish mentorship programs for new hires to improve retention during the initial years of employment.
